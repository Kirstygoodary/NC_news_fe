# The Good News.inc

### A responsive web app demonstration by Kirsty Goodary

> PLEASE NOTE: The Good News.inc is not a real news site, but a demonstration of front-end web development, written from scratch over one week. The articles, users and comments featured here are placeholders only and do not represent the thoughts or feelings of any actual users. For now, The Good News.inc is optimised for Google Chrome browser, and some features may not work well on other browsers. This is purely due to the time constraints of the project, and this may be updated in the near future.

Welcome to The Good News.inc! I tried to design the site to create a modern interface for news stories, representing positive news stories with a clean, modern design. Please take a few minutes navigate around the site and explore.

Please feel free to clone the project from GitHub to your local machine and test the functionality locally. Ensure that git is installed on your computer, navigate to the folder where you would like the project folder to be placed and type the following command into Terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Kirstygoodary/NC_news_fe.git
```

Then navigate into the 'nc-news-frontend' folder and run the commands:

```
npm install
npm start

```

The local react server should start and the project should appear in your browser. Feel free to browse the code, starting with src/app.js

Unfortunately, the Good News.inc does not currently support the creating of secure user accounts. The user functionality you see here is a demonstration of how such a feature might look, were it to implemented. By default, you will be logged in as the user 'jessjelly'. As jessjelly, you can post comments and likes, and also delete your own comments.

The web app you see here was designed to make use of the NC News Backend server, which I also wrote from scratch in a week. If you'd like to try the public-facing API for the backend yourself, go to  [[https://kirsty-g-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api](https://kirsty-g-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api) to see a list of endpoints. You can also check out the github page at  [[https://github.com/Kirstygoodary/nc_news](https://github.com/Kirstygoodary/nc_news)]
